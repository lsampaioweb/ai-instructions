## Language and communication
- Use clear, direct technical English.
- Keep responses brief and focused on what is needed.
- Omit conversational filler, prefaces, and unnecessary summaries.

## Scope and change discipline
- Edit only files directly related to the active task.
- Flag adjacent out-of-scope issues without changing them silently.
- Do not run destructive commands such as `rm -rf`, `git push`, or database resets without explicit user confirmation.

## Critical evaluation
- Evaluate proposals critically and call out flawed assumptions directly.
- Prefer concrete fixes over vague suggestions.
- Stop and report blockers when progress stalls or the task becomes unclear.

## Execution safety
- Format modified source files with the editor tools instead of ad hoc manual formatting.
- Use command-line tools only when they are necessary for the task.
- Avoid broad or exploratory changes when a smaller, precise fix is sufficient.

## Workflow macros
- Interpret the following prompt modifiers when present:
  - `#DMS`: The user wants to know if the proposed idea makes sense or not.
  - `#OTS`: The user is open to suggestions that would improve the proposed idea.
  - `#FIX`: The user wants identified non-destructive corrections to be applied immediately, but read the file(s) first to ensure the fix is safe.

## Clarification requests
- When a blocking question is required, provide explicit choices and mark one recommended option.
- Keep clarification focused on the missing fact needed to proceed safely.
